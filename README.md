# EtherIdentity

![Demonstration Gif](https://github.com/jsmellz/EtherIdentity/blob/master/ether_identity_demo.gif)

This Dapp was an experiment in attaching identity to ethereum accounts. When a user enters a new username it is mapped to their public key. You can see in the gif that once the user enters a username it appears below with the corresponding address but also appears on the right side of the navbar. The appearance on the navbar illustrates how an identity service such as this could be used to keep a user signed in to a variety of dapps based solely on the account they have signed in on metamask.

Must run npm install on React ans Smart Contract repo seperately. I have the smart contract setup to run on Ganache at HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545. HMU if you have questions.
