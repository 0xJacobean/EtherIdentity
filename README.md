# EtherIdentity

![Demonstration Gif](https://github.com/jsmellz/EtherIdentity/blob/master/ether_identity_demo.gif)

This Dapp was an experiment in attaching identity to ethereum accounts. When a user enters a new username it is mapped to their public key within the smart contract. Notice that in the gif once the user enters a username it appears below with the corresponding address but their username also appears on the right side of the navbar. The appearance on the navbar illustrates how an identity service like this could be used to keep a user signed in across a variety of dapps based solely on the account they have signed in on metamask.

Users can also overwrite their username just by adding a new one within the dapp. 

Must run npm install on React and Smart Contract repo seperately. I have the smart contract setup to run on Ganache at HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545. HMU if you have questions.
